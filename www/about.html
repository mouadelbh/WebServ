                <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    1337 is not just a school; it's a revolution in IT education. Inspired by the innovative 42 Network, 1337 offers a unique, tuition-free learning experience that is entirely project-based and peer-to-peer. We believe in empowering individuals to take control of their learning journey, fostering creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration.

                    There are no traditional teachers, no lectures, and no fixed schedules. Instead, students (often called "cadets") learn by doing, working on a series of challenging projects that cover a wide spectrum of IT skills, from basic programming to complex systems architecture, AI, cybersecurity, and more.

                        The journey at 1337 begins with the "Piscine" (French for 'swimming pool'). This is an intensive, month-long coding bootcamp designed to test motivation, adaptability, and problem-solving skills. It's a challenging but rewarding experience that serves as the selection process and an introduction to our learning methodology.
